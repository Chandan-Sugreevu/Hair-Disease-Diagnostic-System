# Hair-Disease-Diagnostic-System
Hair Disease Diagnosis System
Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based scalp hair inspection and diagnosis system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images of the scalp into different categories of hair conditions, such as alopecia, dandruff, and healthy scalp. The system aims to aid in the early diagnosis and treatment planning for various hair health issues.

-->Technologies
Python, TensorFlow, Keras: For building and training the CNN model.

OpenCV, PIL: For image processing.

Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data visualization.


-->Project Structure
The project  contains the following main sections:

Data: Contains the raw dataset, including the images and labels for training the model.

Model: Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for training and evaluating the CNN model.

Preprocessing: Code to handle data cleaning, resizing, and augmenting the images before feeding them into the model.

Evaluation: Code to evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results: Visualizations of the model's performance and sample predictions.

-->Model Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the model was evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The percentage of correctly classified images.

Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.

Recall: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.

F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

The model achieved an accuracy of 98.58%, making it highly effective at diagnosing hair diseases from images.

-->Future Work
Model Improvement: Further improve the model by training on a larger, more diverse dataset to handle edge cases.

Real-time Diagnosis: Implement a real-time diagnosis system for mobile or desktop applications.

Integration with Medical Databases: Link the diagnostic system with medical databases for more advanced predictions and treatments.

-->Conclusion
This Hair Disease Diagnosis System leverages deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, to provide an efficient and accurate solution for identifying different hair and scalp conditions. The system can aid in early diagnosis and offer insights into potential treatments for patients dealing with hair loss or other scalp-related problems.
